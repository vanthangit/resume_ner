| Project Description | A new request comes from Rivet Software (http://www.rivetsoftware.com/) to provide a solution for conversion of MS Word documents formatted for SEC (http://www.sec.gov/) reporting requirements primarily for 10-K and 10-Q filings from Microsoft Word format into HTML as specified by the SEC. The relevant SEC documents are publically available on the internet and provide guidance around the subset of HTML tags that can be used in submissions. The solution should read MS Word documents (.DOCX, only Word 2010 and 2007) and convert to HTML files to be filed in the EDGAR system in SEC. The output (HTML files) must follow certain rules defined by SEC to be EDGAR-valid and to be able to file in the EDGAR system (Validity), make it the same appearance as the original Word documents (Fidelity). In addition, the solution will then integrate to Rivet's software Crossfire (Integration) but it is not a scope of work for the initial phase of the project. Scope :  Develop features base on framework with EDGAR system rule. |

| Project Description | PIMS is a desktop application, which is used to manage prisoner's information: due in, due out, sentence, correspondence... and reporting system. The system can be deployed as a sub-system for complete solution. Advanced technologies such as .NET 3.5, DevExpresss 9.2, Oracle 10g, CCNet, FxCop... run this project with 4 teams of 4 members for each group. Perforce is used for source code control and automatic builds are setup to run on schedules and control by cruise control application to ensure the latest build status available to all teams. Many acceptance criteria for QA and technical review are created and spread through all teams to control the qualification of each release. Scope :  Re-structure and migrate all data from the old system, based-on .NET 3.5 SP1. |
