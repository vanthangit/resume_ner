## PERSONAL STATEMENT

Technology has been a passion of mine since the age of 14 when I was given my first computer.  Since then I've become a strong Senior Developer and Leader.  I've created hundreds of applications, worked with small businesses to Fortune 500 corporations, built teams where groups once existed - ultimately becoming a passionate and self-motivated developer.

I enjoy team environments that feed off each other's passion for what they do; who seek performance and optimization over what's easy or quick.   I believe that this is the environment for which success is brewed, and results are delivered.

So, are you looking for a strong WORDPRESS developer who takes development seriously, is willing to lead/mentor others and still maintain a good sense of humor?  If so, give me the message and let's talk!
