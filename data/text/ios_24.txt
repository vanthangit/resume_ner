## Profile / Objective

I have been interested in the code lines since I was at high school. The feeling of passion always overflows once I research algorithms, therefore I had a decision of studying information technology. Learning IT in four years, it gave me the background to move on discovering more about new technologies in deep. Beside, some of subjects equipped me helpful skills such as teamwork, communication, presentation, that is very important for my work. A few years of work experience I got many challenges and always researched to resolve it very well, I noticed that facing and tackling the challenges is the best way to improve myself. I learn about new technologies day by day until I am eligible to build useful applications for community, get income from it.
