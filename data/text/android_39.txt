A highly motivated software engineer with comprehensive knowledge of software techniques, and good experience of existing software applications. I am seeking to work with a reputed software company to achieve new levels of competence.

Mobile computing devices and indoor wireless networks has been emerging rapidly and driving for interests in indoor location-based application. In my thesis, I present  Wilo (Wifi Localization),  an  Indoor  Location-Based  Mobile  Recommender  Application. Wilo uses a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based technique  to localize current location of user and from that it gives suggestion on local events.  Additionally, Wilo is integrated with a Points and Reward system that can be applied to many different contexts in reality to  keep  users stay longer  in  places or  to  reward  users  by  their  loyalty. The thesis  also present  a  solution  to  solve  a common problem  that  can  be  encountered  in  Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor localization called Out of Map problem.
