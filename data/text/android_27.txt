## Database Management Systems

I have experience with Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and SQLite. My specialty is Information System. I feel very confident with Database designing and analyzing. I am comfortable with complicated SQL queries. Besides the basic manipulating with database management tools, I can write and maintain store procedures, triggers, and cursors.

## Language Skills

I have not ever joined to any English test so I have no certificate for my English skills. During the time I was a student as well as in my currently job, I have to read many English technical textbooks. In addition, I have to communicate through emails by English during working days. So that, I feel confident with reading and writing skill but not very much in speaking and listening since I have little chance to practice.

## Personal Qualities

I am confident, enthusiastic and active. I am willing to do whatever to finish my job even under presser and challenge. In addition, I am adaptable and progressive. I always improve myself to reach my further objectives wherever I work.

## Interests

Whenever I have free time, I usually read newspapers and listen to music. Sometimes I watch some short films, which talk about some heroes or underworld groups. I didn't like long films as well as online games. They waste time and money.
