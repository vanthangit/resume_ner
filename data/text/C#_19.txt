| Project Description | Description : Cape is an international leader in the provision of essential industrial services focused on the energy and natural resources sectors. They offer a range of multi-disciplinary services which includes access systems, insulation, refractory linings, painting, coatings, blasting, industrial cleaning, training and assessment throughout the lifecycle of large secure industrial assets. Painting, Insulation and Fireproofing (PIF) are a key service offering from Cape and the management of these is the key focus of the PIF system requirements. These three services are both linked and separated for operations on sites as some specific work scopes will require the asset to undergo all three where as others might only require a single service or a mixture of both. |
